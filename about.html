      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>​﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿This website was created out of my love of food, my passion for photography and my desire to share the stories about my life with others. 

        If you are looking for culinary inspiration or motivation - you're in the right place.  Spend a few minutes, scrolling through the pictures in the recipe index and you're bound to find a few that you'd like to try.  There are over a thousand easy to follow recipes, each accompanied by tantalizing photographs to help guide you through the each step of the recipe process. 
        
        To get the full story on the latest recipes that I'm making, check out my blog posts.  The blog is also a great place to learn more about me and the stories that make up my crazy life.  </p>
